# TechContracts-SaaS-wSubs
From TechContracts.com

So far ... the Form is in ProseObject format.  It has parameterized a) Deal Points, b) Cross-References, c) Defined Terms.  The keys are still numerical, reflecting the section numbering.  In future, they could be made semantic, reflecting the subject matter of the sections (Conf, Dispute, Rep, etc.)

The Form currently is a single file, and all its dependencies are to standard ProseObject widgets ( =[G/Z/ol/3] etc. ).  So it can be mounted anywhere in the /Doc/ tree, or even just reference this directly via the =[?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommonAccord/TechContracts-SaaS-wSubs/main/Form/001.md]. 

We suggest mounting this as /G/TechContracts/SaaS/ToS-wSubs/.
